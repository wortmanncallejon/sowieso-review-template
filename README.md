# sowieso Review Template

This repository contains a LaTeX template for a nicely set review of a [sowieso](https://sowieso-journal.de/) article. 

The template contains an informative header that can easily be anonymised by commenting out line `27` and uncommenting line `28`.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your computer.
2. Navigate to the target directory.

```bash
   cd path/to/directory
```

3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wortmanncallejon/sowieso-review-template.git
```

Do - however - **not** fork this repository, as this would endanger anonymity.

Once you have downloaded the template, you can type your review into the `.tex` file and compile locally or on a service such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
