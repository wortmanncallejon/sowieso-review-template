In this article we collect the ideas of journal editors in political science and several recent PhDs, who met as a panel at the 2011 American Political Science Association Annual Meeting to discuss the principles of the review process. This includes why reviewing is important to the development of one's own scholarship but also offers some nuts and bolts on reviewing.},

	abstract = {Control variables are included in regression analyses to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome. In this article, we argue that the estimated effect sizes of control variables are unlikely to have a causal interpretation themselves though. This is because even valid controls are possibly endogenous and therefore represent a combination of several different causal mechanisms operating jointly on the outcome, which is hard to interpret theoretically. We recommend to refrain from reporting marginal effects of controls in regression tables and to focus exclusively on the variables of interest in the results sections of quantitative research papers. Moreover, we advise against using control variable estimates for subsequent theory building and meta-analyses.},
